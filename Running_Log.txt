*If subject isn't mentioned, experiment run was unremarkable.

Pilot014 - Potentially not neurotypical. 
026 - smelled like pot, abruptly started listening to music and not paying attention to
the task. Told the subject to turn off music and pay attention - he did, but when checking
on him later, I noticed that you wouldn't respond often. During the test phase, it
seems like he was just selected answers as quickly as possible to get out.
