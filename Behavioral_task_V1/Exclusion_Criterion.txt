Exclude subjects if:

If, during test, responses are not consistent with either task-set. This enforces that
the subject knows the two task-sets (so they know the two responses for blue circle - either
the circle response or the blue response), and that we are testing how they choose between
the task-sets.

Thus chance performance should be 50%, not 25%, because the action -> TS mapping should
be full learned.

This isn't to say subjects that are below chance during test aren't doing the task - they may
have learned an inappropriate rule governing task-set switching leading to categorically
incorrect performance. However, they still should conform to the task-set actions, and 
thus only err by picking the wrong task-set.

Put another way, if I recoded accuracy based on whether they used either of the two
actions associated with a current TS (so the blue action or the red action would be coded
as 'color TS'), or whether they conformed to the stimulus across task-sets (so 'blue action'
and 'circle action' would both be coded as 'correct' for a blue circle), we will exclude
people if the second metric falls below some threshold (it should at least be greater
than chance). TS accuracy is the metric of interest.
